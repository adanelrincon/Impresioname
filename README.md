-----------------------------------

## Installation Manual <a name="idUserManual"></a> üîß

    To start using the app, we will need ReactJS, NodeJS and MySQL as Data Base.

<br>

### Install NodeJS
    
_*You need to download and install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current)*._

You can check your version with:  

    npm -v

_*Recommended to have version: 9.6.7 or higher*._

<br>

### Install the Project and the Dependencies üíæ

*Then, you need to git clone the repository:*.

    git clone https://github.com/adanelrincon/Impresioname.git

<br>

*When we have the cloned project, we will move to the backend folder to install the dependencies this way:*.

     cd Impresioname/
     cd backend/
     npm install

<br>

*In another terminal we will do the same, we will go to the folder in which we have cloned the project and we will follow these commands:*.

     cd Impresioname/
     cd frontend/
     npm install

<br><br>

### Initialize the Project üíª

*First, in MySQL you need to create a new Data Base*.

<img src="img\DBCreate.png" width="300"  alt="MainView" >

<br>

*Then, in the backend you need to create the .env with your data*.

<br>

<img src="img\DBConfig.png" width="300"  alt="MainView" >

<br>

*If you don't know how to do it, I have a .env.example which you can copy and change the name to .env, once this you would fill it in with your data:*.

<br>

<img src="img\DBConfigExample.png" width="300"  alt="MainView" >

<br>

DB_NAME will be the name of the DB that we created previously, and DB_PASSWORD_ will be the root user password to access the same DB.

<br>

*To start the backend we will follow this command being inside the /backend folder of the project:*.

     npm run dev

<br>

*To start the frontend we will follow this command being inside the /frontend folder of the project:*.

     npm start

## Built With üõ†Ô∏è

_For this project I use Ionic, Node js and MySQL_

* [Ionic](ionicframework.com) - Ionic is a complete open-source SDK for hybrid mobile app development created by Max Lynch, Ben Sperry, and Adam Bradley of Drifty Co. in 2013. The original version was released in 2013 and built on top of AngularJS and Apache Cordova. However, the latest release was re-built as a set of Web Components, allowing the user to choose any user interface framework, such as Angular, React or Vue.js.
<br><br>


* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/es/) - Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting‚Äîrunning scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser.
<br><br>

* [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com) - MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). Its name is a combination of "My", the name of co-founder Michael Widenius's daughter, and "SQL", the abbreviation for Structured Query Language. A relational database organizes data into one or more data tables in which data types may be related to each other; these relations help structure the data. SQL is a language programmers use to create, modify and extract data from the relational database, as well as control user access to the database.
