## Installation Manual <a name="idUserManual"></a> üîß

    To start using the app, we will need ReactJS, NodeJS and MySQL as Data Base.

<br>

### Install NodeJS
    
_*You need to download and install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current)*._

You can check your version with:  

    npm -v

_*Recommended to have version: 9.6.7 or higher*._

<br>

### Install the Project and the Dependencies üíæ

*Then, you need to git clone the repository:*.

    git clone https://github.com/adanelrincon/Impresioname.git

<br>

*When we have the cloned project, we will move to the backend folder to install the dependencies this way:*.

     cd Impresioname/
     cd backend/
     npm install

<br>

*In another terminal we will do the same, we will go to the folder in which we have cloned the project and we will follow these commands:*.

     cd Impresioname/
     cd frontend/
     npm install

<br><br>

### Initialize the Project üíª

*First, in MySQL you need to create a new Data Base*.

<img src="img\DBCreate.png" width="300"  alt="MainView" >

<br>

*Then, in the backend you need to create the .env with your data*.

<br>

<img src="img\DBConfig.png" width="300"  alt="MainView" >

<br>

*If you don't know how to do it, I have a .env.example which you can copy and change the name to .env, once this you would fill it in with your data:*.

<br>

<img src="img\DBConfigExample.png" width="300"  alt="MainView" >

<br>

DB_NAME will be the name of the DB that we created previously, and DB_PASSWORD_ will be the root user password to access the same DB.

<br>

*To start the backend we will follow this command being inside the /backend folder of the project:*.

     npm run dev

<br>

*To start the frontend we will follow this command being inside the /frontend folder of the project:*.

     npm start

## BUILD WITH <a name="idTech"></a> üõ†Ô∏è

MySQL:

* MySQL is a relational database management system based on SQL. It's widely used for storing and managing structured data. In the context of your project, MySQL will act as the database to store application data.
<br>

Express:

* Express is a web application framework for NodeJS. In your application, Express will be used as the server-side framework to handle HTTP requests, define routes, and manage server logic.
<br>

NodeJS:
* NodeJS is a JavaScript runtime environment on the server side. In this project, NodeJS will be used to run the application server. Its single-threaded, event-driven nature makes it ideal for scalable and high-performance web applications.
<br>

Sequelize:

* Sequelize is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) for NodeJS. It simplifies interaction with relational databases, such as MySQL, through JavaScript. Sequelize streamlines database queries and provides an object-based data model instead of direct SQL queries.
<br>

ReactJS:

* ReactJS is a JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces. In the context of your project, ReactJS will be used on the client side to build the user interface. You can create reusable components and efficiently manage the application state.
